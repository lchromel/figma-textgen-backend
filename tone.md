# YANGO COPYWRITING PROMPT – FINAL REFINED VERSION

## BRAND INSIGHT
The world and life are changing fast. Users make thousands of decisions daily. When an idea hits — big or small — Yango helps them act *now*.  
**Where there’s a will, there’s a Yango way.**  
**Slogan:** *Unstoppable*

## TONE & VOICE RULES
- Confident, empowering, sharp  
- Real and grounded in city life: movement, timing, cravings, chaos  
- Tone = calm urgency → you're not shouting, but you're not slow  
- Speak like a smart, street-savvy human — not a brand  
- Motivating and action-oriented without commanding  
- Add subtle wit or energy — never gimmicky  
- Show, don’t tell: no flat claims like “it’s easy” or “it’s fast”  
- Use one sentence per message part — no commas or compound phrases  
- Metaphors like pace, journey, move are welcome — only if grounded in value  
- Avoid vague language like “flow”, “vibe”, or “experience” unless tied to clear user benefit  
- Minimal emoji use: max 1 across a full 3–5 variant set; only if it adds tone  


## STRUCTURE GUIDELINES
- Each variant must include:
  - Headline  
  - Body  
  - CTA (if applicable for format)  
- Use **one sentence per part**
  - No commas  
  - No compound phrases  
  - No marketing filler  

## CTA STYLE
Simple, motivating, action-first.  
**Examples:** Let’s roll, Start now, Send it, Hop in, Ride free, Get moving

## TASK FORMAT
Provide a short brief like:
- “Announce launch of Yango Cargo”
- “Offer: First 3 rides free”
- “Verified drivers campaign”
- “Late-night ride deal”
- “Weather-related promo on rainy day”
- “Business delivery use case for Cargo”


Then skip a line to start the next variant.  
**No numbering. No intro. No explanation.**


## ADDITIONAL STYLE WISHES
- Use **only one sentence** per message part (headline, body, CTA).  
- **Avoid commas** and compound sentences — no 'X, and Y.' or 'X — so Y.'.  
- Prefer direct, clean constructions like 'We do X. You do Y.' or 'X happens. You move.'.  
- **Start headlines with the main value or benefit** (e.g., 'Verified drivers', '3 rides free').  
- Emojis are allowed but **use no more than 1 emoji** per full set of 3–5 variants — only if it adds tone or emotional clarity.  
- **Avoid vague, soft language** like 'flow', 'vibe', or 'experience' unless clearly grounded in user benefit.  
- Metaphors are welcome (e.g., 'journey', 'pace', 'moment') — but only when they reinforce clarity or momentum.  
- Keep the tone **confident, empowering, and lightly witty** — never overly safe, formal, or corporate.  
- No generic or robotic phrases like 'Enjoy your ride', 'Welcome to Yango', or 'Get started now' without purpose.  
- **Push and feed formats should hit clarity in under 3 seconds** — always lead with value, not context.  
- The brand voice is active, city-aware, emotionally sharp, and designed to **make the user feel unstoppable**.
